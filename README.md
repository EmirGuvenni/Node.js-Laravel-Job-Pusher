# Node.js-Laravel-Job-Pusher

A library to make pushing Laravel jobs to the Redis easier.

# How does it work?

The library serializes the given parameters, adds the necessary attributes to make it a Laravel job and pushes it to the Horizon's Redis queue.

Optionally, you could only use the LaravelJob class to create a serialized job and send it with your own functions.
